here is some solution to avoid being banned by the server

1, add a delay between each request
-> use DOWNLOAD_DELAY in setting.py

ex: DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 5 -> delay 5 seconds
but this sulution is not suitable for project with many spiders

2, HTTP CACHE
enable in setting.py

the request to the same url will be stored locally, so scrapy will check and get the response instead of fetching new requests

3, use random user-agent for each request
