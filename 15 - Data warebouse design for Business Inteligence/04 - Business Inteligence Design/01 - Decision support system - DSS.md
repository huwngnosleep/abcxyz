DSS contains three components:
- Data management part: getting data from various databases. It can contain a database, a DBMS, data directory and query facility
- Model management subsystem
- User interface subsystem

# 2 - Types of DSS Systems
### 1 - Data Driven
Large amount of numerical data stored in a data warehouse. This system use OLAP to produce reports, dashboards for business performance measure system.

### 2 - Document Driven
This DSS type relies on coding analysis, search and retrieval of documents. A knowledge management system such as WIKIPEDIA fall into this category

### 3 - Knowledge Driven
Artificial neural network and
knowledge-based expert systems fall into this category. 

### 4 - Model Driven
Use optimization tools (such as Machine Learning) to optimize one or more objectives. Microsoft Excel, for example, is a tool commonly used to develop model driven DSS.
These systems may include statistical packages, simulation models,
and many financial and management science models.
