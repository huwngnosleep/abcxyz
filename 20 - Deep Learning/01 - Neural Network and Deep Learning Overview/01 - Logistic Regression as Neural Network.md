# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is mostly the same as Linear Regression, except for using a sigmoid function to reduce the calculation to between 0 and 1, which is better for probability

# Computation Graph represent Gradient Descent 
We can think of each step in Gradient Descent algorithm for Logistic Regression as the graph below
