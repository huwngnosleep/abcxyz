functional dependency happens when some attribute can be defined by another attribute

if A -> B so that A can only have one B

student_id ---> birth_day

we can say that each student_id have only one birth_day
so that this is a functional dependency

while birth_day ---> student_id
we can have multiple student with the same birth_day, so student_id is not dependent on birth_day
