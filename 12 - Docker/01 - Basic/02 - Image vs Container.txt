Image is the application we want to run

Container is an instance of that image running as a process

we can have many containers running of the same image

run an nginx image example

run container, if not exist locally, it will be pulled from docker store
docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx

run container and return the container id
docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach nginx

run container with a specific name
docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost nginx

show webhost container logs
docker container logs webhost

remove container:
docker container rm -f 76f
-f means force
76f = first 3 characters in container id
